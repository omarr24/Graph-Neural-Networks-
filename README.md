# Graph Neural Networks with PyTorch Geometric: Karate Club Network

This repository provides a hands-on introduction to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using PyTorch Geometric. The notebook, **GNNs on the Karate Club Network**, covers the essential concepts of graph-based deep learning and demonstrates the implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on Zacharyâ€™s Karate Club dataset.

## Contents

- **Graph Neural Network Basics**: Understand the fundamentals of GNNs, including message passing and node feature aggregation.
- **Karate Club Dataset**: Use the well-known Karate Club dataset to explore community detection within a social network.
- **PyTorch Geometric Implementation**: Leverage the PyTorch Geometric library for efficient graph data handling and model building.
